# ml-from-scratch

This repository serves to showcase my foundational understanding and practical implementation of various core machine learning algorithms. All algorithms are implemented "from scratch" in Python, emphasizing a deep understanding of their underlying mathematical principles and mechanics.

## Project Structure

Each machine learning concept or algorithm is encapsulated within its own directory. This modular approach highlights specific areas of expertise and allows for easy navigation through different project components.
